# Multi-Agent Accounting System Implementation Strategy

## Current System Analysis

The chat-web-app currently uses:

- **Claude AI** (Anthropic SDK) as the primary AI provider
- **Domain-specific handlers** for GL codes and transaction queries
- **Firebase** for authentication, storage, and Firestore for data
- **Next.js App Router** with API routes for server functionality
- **Audit logging system** for tracking user and system actions
- **Excel file operations** for document editing capabilities

## Compatibility with Current AI Integration

The implementation strategy maintains compatibility with the existing Claude AI integration:

1. **Incremental Migration Approach**
   - The current Claude AI implementation remains the foundation
   - The orchestrator will initially act as a router in front of Claude
   - Specialized agents will be added one by one without disrupting existing functionality

2. **Leveraging Existing Code**
   - Existing domain detection logic (like `mightBeAboutGLCodes` and `isTransactionQuery`) becomes part of the orchestrator's routing logic
   - Excel operations capability remains intact but gets encapsulated as specialized tools

3. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Chat API route stays as the entry point but gradually delegates to the orchestrator
   - Existing chat interface continues working during the transition

4. **Enhanced Context Management**
   - Current context enrichment (where GL code info and transaction data is added) becomes formalized in the memory system
   - Document context handling gets enhanced but follows the same patterns

## Implementation Strategy

   - [ ] Define specialized agent interfaces for each accounting domain
   - [ ] Implement agent registry and discovery mechanism

### Phase 2: Specialized Accounting Agents (3-4 weeks)

4. **Invoice Management Agent**
   - [ ] Create `InvoiceAgent` class with specialized invoice knowledge
   - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for invoices via agent
   - [ ] Connect to existing invoice database tables/collections
   - [ ] Add specialized invoice analysis capabilities

5. **GL/Journal Agent**
   - [ ] Build on existing `findRelevantGLCodes` functionality
   - [ ] Create agent specialized in journal entries and GL transactions
   - [ ] Implement search and creation functions for journal entries
   - [ ] Add specialized accounting reasoning capabilities

6. **Reconciliation Agent**
   - [ ] Leverage existing Sage-style reconciliation functionality
   - [ ] Create specialized agent for bank reconciliation tasks
   - [ ] Implement intelligence for matching and clearing transactions
   - [ ] Add analytics for reconciliation anomaly detection

7. **Accounts Payable Agent**
   - [ ] Create `AccountsPayableAgent` class with specialized AP knowledge
   - [ ] Implement vendor management capabilities
   - [ ] Build bill processing and payment workflow functionality
   - [ ] Add payment scheduling and cash flow optimization
   - [ ] Implement invoice-to-PO matching and verification

8. **Reporting Agent**
   - [ ] Develop agent specialized in financial reporting
   - [ ] Create capabilities for generating common financial reports
   - [ ] Implement data visualization assistance
   - [ ] Connect to existing reporting database tables/queries

### Phase 3: Tool Integration & Enhancement (2-3 weeks)

8. **Excel Integration Enhancement**
   - [ ] Modify existing Excel functionality to work with agent system
   - [ ] Create specialized tools for Excel data analysis
   - [ ] Improve Excel change visualization capabilities
   - [ ] Develop agent-specific Excel templates

9. **Custom Tool Development**
   - [ ] Create tool interfaces compatible with the agent framework
   - [ ] Implement accounting-specific tools (tax calculator, etc.)
   - [ ] Build database access tools with proper security
   - [ ] Create file manipulation tools for reports and documents

10. **Connect External APIs**
    - [ ] Integrate payment processor APIs
    - [ ] Connect to tax calculation services
    - [ ] Implement bank feed integration capabilities
    - [ ] Set up integration with financial data providers

### Phase 4: UI/UX and User Interaction (2 weeks)

11. **Update Chat Interface**
    - [ ] Modify existing `ChatInterface.tsx` to support multi-agent system
    - [ ] Add agent-switching UI components
    - [ ] Implement specialized visualization for different agent outputs
    - [ ] Create agent-specific chat styling

12. **Implement User Preferences**
    - [ ] Create settings for default agent preferences
    - [ ] Build agent feedback mechanism
    - [ ] Implement agent customization options
    - [ ] Add agent selection history

### Phase 5: Testing, Security & Deployment (2-3 weeks)

13. **Security Implementation**
    - [ ] Review authentication for all agent interactions
    - [ ] Implement role-based access control for different agents
    - [ ] Add data validation for all agent inputs
    - [ ] Create agent-specific permission system

14. **Testing Framework**
    - [ ] Develop unit tests for each agent type
    - [ ] Create integration tests for agent collaboration
    - [ ] Implement scenario-based testing for common workflows
    - [ ] Set up continuous testing pipeline

15. **Deployment Strategy**
    - [ ] Design staged rollout plan for agent system
    - [ ] Create fallback mechanisms if agent system fails
    - [ ] Implement monitoring for agent performance
    - [ ] Develop logging strategy for agent operations

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript interfaces for all agent types and communication protocols
- Firestore collections for agent memory and context
- Enhanced audit logging for agent operations
- Well-defined schema for inter-agent communication

## Security Considerations

- All agent operations must maintain existing authentication mechanisms
- Data access through agents should be properly authorized
- Agent actions should be comprehensively logged in audit trail
- Sensitive accounting data must be properly protected

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in human intervention for routine accounting tasks
- Improved accuracy in accounting operations
- Faster response times for complex accounting queries
- Positive user feedback on agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. Start with creating the core `AgentOrchestrator` class
2. Implement basic routing logic between 2-3 initial agents
3. Test with simple accounting scenarios before expanding
4. Gradually migrate existing Claude AI functionality to the new system

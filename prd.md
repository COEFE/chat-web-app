# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Document Chat Assistant

## Overview

The AI Document Chat Assistant is a SaaS web application that enables an admin user to upload, view, and interact with various document types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX/CSV, and images) using an AI-powered chat interface. The application features a split-pane view: one side displays the document preview while the other side hosts a chat powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The AI is capable of answering questions about document content, performing cross-document comparisons, and even editing documents based on user instructions. Version history is maintained for every document change.

This PRD also outlines a recommended tech stack that leverages Next.js (React) for the frontend, serverless APIs on Vercel and Firebase, and a Python-based microservice on Google Cloud Run for advanced document processing.

## Goals

- **Interactive Document Analysis:** Allow the admin to explore document content by asking questions in a chat interface where the AI has full context.
- **AI-Assisted Editing:** Enable the AI to read, compare, and edit Word, Excel, and CSV files on demand. Edits are previewed and must be confirmed by the admin.
- **Unified Document Management:** Provide a seamless interface for uploading documents, tracking versions, and maintaining metadata.
- **Scalable and Secure Deployment:** Build the app on cloud platforms (Firebase, Google Cloud, and Vercel) to ensure rapid iteration and future scalability.
- **Future Expandability:** Lay the groundwork for adding user roles, multi-user collaboration, mobile support, and enhanced billing features.

## User Stories

- **Admin Upload & Analysis:**  
  *As an admin user, I want to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, images) so that I can ask the AI questions and gain insights quickly.*

- **Contextual Q&A in Split-Pane:**  
  *As an admin user, I want to view the document alongside an AI chat so that I can reference specific sections while conversing with the AI.*

- **Multi-Document Comparison:**  
  *As an admin user, I want to select multiple documents and have the AI compare or analyze them together.*

- **AI Editing & Versioning:**  
  *As an admin user, I want to instruct the AI to modify content in DOCX, Excel, or CSV files, preview the proposed changes, and then save a new version of the document.*

- **Secure Access & Future Roles:**  
  *As an admin user, I want the app to be securely accessible via login and to have all sensitive actions protected, while laying a foundation for future role-based access control.*

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- **Admin-Only Access:**  
  Only pre-configured admin users (managed via Firebase Authentication) can log in and access the app.

- **Firebase Authentication:**  
  Use Firebase Auth for email/password (or OAuth) login. This service integrates with Firestore and Storage for secure, role-based access.

- **Authorization & Session Management:**  
  Next.js API routes and/or Firebase Cloud Functions will verify the admin's identity (using Firebase Admin SDK) before processing sensitive operations.

### 2. Document Uploading
- **Supported Formats:**  
  PDF, DOCX, XLSX/CSV, and common image types.

- **File Size Limit:**  
  Each file is limited to 10 MB.

- **Upload Interface:**  
  Implement a drag-and-drop and file-picker UI. Support multi-file uploads for enabling multi-document analysis.

- **Storage & Metadata:**  
  Files are stored in Firebase Storage (organized by document ID and version) with metadata saved in Firestore (filename, type, size, upload date, etc.).

- **Validation & Feedback:**  
  Validate file type/size on upload and show progress indicators during upload.

### 3. Document Viewing & Chat Interface
- **Split-Pane UI:**  
  Use a resizable split-pane layout where:
  - **Left Pane:** Displays the document preview.
  - **Right Pane:** Hosts the chat interface.

- **Document Rendering:**  
  - **PDFs:** Use PDF.js (via a React wrapper such as `react-pdf`).
  - **Word (DOCX):** Either convert to PDF for display or use a library like Mammoth.js to render HTML.
  - **Excel/CSV:** Parse using SheetJS (xlsx) to display data in an HTML table or grid.
  - **Images:** Display natively with basic zoom/pan if needed.

- **AI Chat Interface:**  
  Build a chat UI using a pre-built React chat component (e.g., Chat UI Kit) to handle messaging. The chat passes user queries and displays AI responses.
  
- **Multi-Document Context:**  
  Allow selection of multiple documents to feed into the AI for comparative analysis. The UI may list selected filenames and display one primary preview (with the option to switch).

### 4. AI-Driven Editing
- **AI Instruction Workflow:**  
  The admin can ask Claude to perform actions such as "rewrite this paragraph" or "add a total row to the spreadsheet." AI responses are previewed before being applied.

- **Supported File Edits:**  
  - **Word (DOCX):** Use Python's `python-docx` for making text changes.
  - **Excel/CSV:** Use Python's OpenPyXL (or Node's SheetJS) to update cell values and formulas.
  - **PDFs/Images:** Direct editing is not supported; instead, the AI may provide recommendations.

- **Preview and Confirmation:**  
  Display differences (via a simple diff view) and require the admin to confirm edits.

- **Version History:**  
  Each approved edit creates a new version stored in Firebase Storage. Firestore maintains a version history log with timestamps and edit summaries.

### 5. Document Management
- **Library Interface:**  
  Display a list/grid of uploaded documents with key metadata.

- **Versioning & History:**  
  Enable viewing and downloading previous versions. Allow reverting to a prior version if necessary.

- **Deletion & Metadata:**  
  Provide options for document deletion (with confirmation) and allow for future tagging or categorization.

### 6. AI Integration & Interaction
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration:**  
  Use Anthropic's API (via its TypeScript or Python SDK) to power the AI chat. Claude's large context window (up to 200k tokens) enables full-document analysis and multi-document comparisons.

- **Context Feeding:**  
  For each chat session, send the full text (or key extracted content) of the document(s) along with the user query to Claude.

- **Structured Editing Responses:**  
  Prompt Claude to output changes in a structured format (or full revised text) that can be programmatically applied by the backend.

- **Error & Context Management:**  
  Maintain conversation history for follow-up questions, and gracefully handle API errors or limits.

  Develop a separate microservice using **Flask** or **FastAPI** (deployed on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)) for advanced document processing (e.g., editing DOCX via `python-docx` and Excel via OpenPyXL). This service handles:
  - File parsing and text extraction.
  - Applying AI-generated edits to documents.
  - Returning the new version of the file to be saved in Firebase Storage.

### Storage & Database
- **Firebase Storage:**  
  Store uploaded files (and their versions) in Firebase Storage (backed by Google Cloud Storage).

- **Firestore:**  
  Use Cloud Firestore to store:
  - Document metadata (filename, type, upload date, etc.).
  - Version history for each document.
  - Chat session logs (if persisted) or audit logs for AI interactions.

### Authentication & Security
- **Firebase Authentication:**  
  Manage secure login (admin-only for MVP) and use Firebase's built-in features to protect access.

- **Security Rules:**  
  Set up Firestore and Storage security rules to ensure that only authenticated (admin) users can access the data.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Securely store sensitive keys (Anthropic API key, Firebase service account details) using Vercel and Cloud Run environment configurations.

### AI Integration

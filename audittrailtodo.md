# Audit Trail Implementation Plan

## 1. Objective
To implement a comprehensive and robust audit trail system that logs important actions and changes throughout the application. This system will enhance security, accountability, and traceability by recording who did what, and when. Audit logs will be stored in a vector database for efficient querying and analysis.

## 2. Key Information to Log for Each Audit Entry
Each audit log entry should capture at least the following information:
- `timestamp`: The exact date and time when the action occurred (UTC).
- `user_id`: Identifier of the user who performed the action.
- `user_name`: Name or email of the user (for easier readability).
- `action_type`: A clear description of the action performed (e.g., `BILL_CREATED`, `BILL_UPDATED`, `USER_LOGIN`, `PERMISSION_CHANGED`).
- `entity_type`: The type of entity affected (e.g., `Bill`, `User`, `LineItem`).
- `entity_id`: The unique identifier of the entity affected.
- `changes_made`: (Optional, but highly recommended for updates) A structured representation (e.g., JSON diff) of the data before and after the change.
    - `old_value`: The value before the change.
    - `new_value`: The value after the change.
- `source_ip`: IP address from which the action was initiated (if available and relevant).
- `status`: Outcome of the action (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`).
- `error_details`: (If status is `FAILURE`) Details about the error.
- `context`: (Optional) Any additional contextual information relevant to the action (e.g., session ID, request ID).

## 3. Storage: Vector Database
- **Schema Design**:
    - Design a schema for the vector database that accommodates all the fields listed above.
    - Consider indexing strategies for efficient querying, especially on `timestamp`, `user_id`, `action_type`, and `entity_id`.
    - Determine how to best represent `changes_made` for effective vector search if needed (e.g., embedding textual descriptions of changes).
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define how long audit logs will be retained.
- **Security**: Ensure that access to the audit log data is restricted and secured.

## 4. Key Actions to Audit
Identify critical actions across the application. Examples include:

### Accounts Payable Module:
- **Bills:**
    - Creation of a new bill (`BILL_CREATED`)
    - Update of an existing bill (`BILL_UPDATED`) - log specific fields changed.
    - Deletion of a bill (`BILL_DELETED`)
    - Status changes of a bill (e.g., `BILL_PAID`, `BILL_APPROVED`)
- **Line Items (within Bills):**
    - Addition of a line item (`LINE_ITEM_ADDED`)
    - Update of a line item (`LINE_ITEM_UPDATED`)
    - Deletion of a line item (`LINE_ITEM_DELETED`)
- **Vendors:**
    - Creation of a new vendor (`VENDOR_CREATED`)
    - Update of a vendor (`VENDOR_UPDATED`)
    - Deletion of a vendor (`VENDOR_DELETED`)

### User Management & Authentication:
- User login attempt (successful/failed) (`USER_LOGIN_SUCCESS`, `USER_LOGIN_FAILURE`)
- User logout (`USER_LOGOUT`)
- User registration (`USER_REGISTERED`)
- Password change/reset (`USER_PASSWORD_CHANGED`, `USER_PASSWORD_RESET_REQUESTED`)
- User profile updates (`USER_PROFILE_UPDATED`)
- Role/permission changes (`USER_ROLE_ASSIGNED`, `USER_PERMISSION_GRANTED`)

### System & Configuration:
- Changes to critical application settings (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_UPDATED`).
- Major administrative actions.

## 5. Implementation Steps

1.  **Finalize Audit Log Schema**: Confirm the fields and data types for the audit log entries in the vector database.
2.  **Develop Audit Logging Service/Module**:
    - Create a reusable service or utility function (e.g., `auditLogger.logAction(auditData)`) responsible for constructing and sending audit log entries to the vector database.
    - This service should be easily callable from various parts of the application (primarily API routes).
    - Ensure it handles potential errors during logging gracefully (e.g., database connectivity issues) without disrupting core application functionality.
3.  **Integrate Logging into API Routes**:
    - Identify all relevant API endpoints. The key Accounts Payable API routes identified are:
        - `frontend/src/app/api/bills/route.ts` (for creating bills and listing all bills)
        - `frontend/src/app/api/bills/[id]/route.ts` (for fetching, updating, and deleting a specific bill)
        - `frontend/src/app/api/vendors/route.ts` (for creating vendors and listing all vendors)
        - `frontend/src/app/api/vendors/[id]/route.ts` (for fetching, updating, and deleting a specific vendor)
        - `frontend/src/app/api/bill-payments/route.ts` (for operations related to bill payments)
    - Modify these endpoints to call the `auditLogger` service after successful operations or significant attempts.
    - For updates, capture both old and new values of modified fields to include in `changes_made`.
4.  **Integrate Logging for Authentication Events**:
    - Hook into Firebase authentication events (or your auth provider's mechanisms) to log login, logout, and other auth-related actions.
5.  **Develop Mechanism for `changes_made`**:
    - Implement a strategy to effectively capture and represent data changes. This might involve comparing object states before and after an operation.
6.  **Testing**:
    - Write unit tests for the audit logging service.
    - Perform integration tests to ensure actions are correctly logged from API endpoints.
    - Verify that audit logs are correctly stored and retrievable from the vector database.
7.  **Documentation**:
    - Document the audit trail system, including the schema, how to add new audit points, and how to query the logs.
8.  **(Optional) Admin Interface for Audit Logs**:
    - Consider developing a UI for administrators to view, search, and filter audit logs.

## 6. Technical Considerations
- **Performance Impact**:
    - Asynchronous logging: Send audit logs asynchronously to avoid impacting the performance of primary application requests.
    - Batching: Consider batching multiple log entries if the logging volume is very high.
- **Security of Audit Logs**:
    - Protect audit logs from tampering and unauthorized access.
    - Encrypt sensitive data within logs if necessary.
- **Scalability**:
    - Ensure the vector database and logging mechanism can handle the expected volume of audit data as the application grows.
- **Error Handling**:
    - Implement robust error handling within the logging service. Decide on a strategy if logging fails (e.g., retry, log to a fallback).
- **Consistency**:
    - Ensure consistent formatting and terminology for `action_type` and other enumerated fields.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for specific critical or suspicious audit events (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, deletion of critical data).
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Develop capabilities to generate reports from audit data for compliance or internal review.
- **Automated Anomaly Detection**: Explore using AI/ML on the vector audit logs to detect unusual patterns of activity.

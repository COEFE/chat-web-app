## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Always use the appropriate account for each transaction type.
2. **Level of Detail**: Choose the most specific account that applies to a transaction.
3. **New Accounts**: When a new account is needed, follow the numbering convention and hierarchy.
4. **Account Descriptions**: Include clear descriptions for all accounts to ensure proper usage.
5. **Periodic Review**: Review the chart of accounts at least annually to ensure it meets business needs.

## Account Types and Financial Statements

Each account is classified with one of the following types which determines how it appears in financial statements:

- **asset**: Appears on the Balance Sheet (debit balance)
- **liability**: Appears on the Balance Sheet (credit balance)
- **equity**: Appears on the Balance Sheet (credit balance)
- **revenue**: Appears on the Income Statement (credit balance)
- **expense**: Appears on the Income Statement (debit balance)

## Implementation

The standardized chart of accounts is implemented through a SQL migration script that creates or updates accounts according to this structure. The script preserves existing transaction data while organizing accounts into a more logical and consistent hierarchy.
